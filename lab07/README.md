# Lab 7 - Camtrans

![](/lab07/img/0000.PNG)

## Prologue

In this lab, you will create your own virtual camera. This camera will use various viewing
properties to produce a transformation matrix to display 3D graphics on our 2D output devices.
The code written in this lab will be used in future assignments.

## Intro

When rendering a three-dimensional scene, you need to go through several stages. One of the
first steps is to take the objects you have in the scene and break them into triangles. You did that
in the shapes assignment. The next step is to place those triangles in their proper position in the scene.
Not all objects will be at the “standard” object position, and you need some way of resizing,
moving, and orienting them so that they are where they belong. There remains but one
important step: to define how the triangulated objects in the three-dimensional scene are
displayed on the two-dimensional screen. This is accomplished through the use of a camera
transformation, a matrix that you apply to a point in three-dimensional space to find its
projection on a two-dimensional plane.

The camera transformation typically also handles positioning and orienting the camera so that
we can easily change where the scene is viewed from. It is entirely possible to leave out this
component - all that you would have to do is make sure you position your objects such that they
fall within the standard view volume. But this is tedious and inflexible. What happens if you
create a scene, and decide that you want to look at it from a slightly different angle or position?
You would have to go through and reposition everything to fit your generic camera
transformation. Do this often enough and before long you would really wish you had decided to
become a sailing instructor instead of coming to Brown and studying computer science.

For this assignment, you will be creating a camera object that provides the methods for several
adjustments that one could perform on a camera. Once that has been completed, you will
possess all the tools needed to handle displaying three-dimensional objects oriented in any way
and viewed from any position.

## Getting Started

This assignment will be completed within the code you have been using for your projects, mainly
inside the /camera folder.

Since it is a part of the project code, you can run the demo using the regular project demo
on the department machines in person or through FastX3 (/course/cs123/bin/cs1230_demo).

### Demo

To see the Camtrans camera in action, switch to the 3D canvas, select the “Camtrans” tab, and
make sure “Use orbit camera instead” is unchecked. The demo uses the following defaults for the
camera’s initial state.

```
● The near clip plane is 1 and the far clip plane is 30.
● The vertical view angle is 60 degrees.
● The screen aspect ratio is 1:1.
● The eye position of the camera is at (2,2,2) in world coordinates.
● The camera is looking at the origin, and its up vector is (0,1,0) in world coordinates.
```
The translate and rotate dials modify the camera’s position relative to a virtual set of axes, which
represent the camera’s “local” coordinate space. In the camera’s coordinate space, the camera is
located at (0, 0, 0), the camera is looking along the negative Z axis, the Y axis is pointing
upwards, and the X axis is pointing to the right. To emphasize the difference between the
world’s coordinate space and the camera’s “local” coordinate space, the camera space axes are
usually referred to as W, V , and U, respectively. When you move the camera, this set of axes
moves with it.


```
● The “ <x, y or z>-axis ” buttons position the camera so that it is located two units along
      the <x, y or z> axis, pointing towards the origin.
● The “ Axonometric ” button positions the camera such that it is located at the point (2,
      2, 2) and is pointing towards the origin.
● The “ FOV ” slider adjusts the camera’s field of view by setting the height angle.
● The “ Near ” and “ Far ” sliders set the locations of the near and far clipping planes.
● Finally, the “ Aspect ratio ” label reflects the aspect ratio of the rendered image, which
      can be adjusted by resizing the window.
```
### OpenGL Mathematics (GLM)

GLM is a C++ mathematics library which provides useful implementations of matrices and
vectors as well as functions which can perform matrix transformations. In this lab, you should
use GLM to store and transform matrices and vectors. Some of the classes/functions you can use
are:


● glm::mat4x4- A 4x4 matrix.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ glm::mat4x4 mat = glm::mat4x4(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,
0, 0, 0, 1);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ The default constructor for glm::mat4x4 constructs an identity matrix.<br />

● glm::vec3 or glm::vec4- 3D and 4D vectors.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ glm::vec3 v = glm::vec3(1,0,0);<br />

● glm::transpose(glm::mat4x4 m)- Returns m^T, the transpose of matrix m.<br />

● glm::normalize(glm::vec3 v)- Normalizes v and returns the resulting vector.<br />

● glm::dot(glm::vec3 v1, glm::vec3 v2) - Returns the dot product of two vectors
(v1 and v2).<br />

● glm::cross(glm::vec3 v1, glm::vec3 v2)- Returns the cross product of two
vectors (v1 and v2).<br />

● glm::radians(float degrees)- Converts from degrees to radians.<br />

● Trigonometry functions: glm::sin(float rad), glm::cos(...), glm::tan(...),
glm::acos(...), glm::asin(...), glm::atan(...)<br />

● Overridden operators:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Adding vectors: glm::vec3 result = v1 + v2;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Scalar-vector multiplication: glm::vec3 result = 2 * v;<br />

● You can access/mutate the components of a vector:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ glm::vec3 v = glm::vec3(2,3,4);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ v.x // == 2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ v.y // == 3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ v.z // == 4<br />

**However, you may NOT use the following GLM functions for this lab:** <br />
```
● glm::lookAt(...)
● glm::perspective(...)
● glm::scale(...)
● glm::rotate(...)
● glm::translate(...)
```
**IMPORTANT:** GLM and OpenGL use **column-major** matrixorder. The lectures describe
matrices in row-major order. This means that, if you write out matrices in row-major order
when constructing GLM matrices, you should transpose them with glm::transpose(...)
before storing them.

For example: glm::mat4x4 columnMajorMatrix = glm::transpose(glm::mat4x4(/* row
major matrix values */ ));

## Additional Notes / FAQ

### Aspect Ratio

Below is the view frustum, where **p = (px, py, pz)** is the eye position, **near** is the distance from
p to the near plane, and **far** is the distance from p to the farplane:

<p>
    <img src="/lab07/img/0002.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

Here **w** and **h** are the width and height of the section of the frustum on the far plane, which is a
distance **far** away from the eye position. The **aspect ratio** is the ratio of width to height:


aspect = w<sub>near</sub>/h<sub>near</sub> = w/h

To calculate the projection matrix, the lecture slides use the angles θ<sub>w</sub> and
θ<sub>h</sub>, which are related to everything as follows:



w/2 = far ∗ tan(θ<sub>w</sub>/2)


h/2 = far ∗ tan(θ<sub>h</sub>/2)

Note that this means the aspect ratio is NOT equal to θw/θh. The aspect ratio relates the
tangents of the angles, not the angles themselves. The GUI will give you the height angle θ<sub>h</sub> in the setHeightAngle() method in _/camera/CamtransCamera.h_. You can get θ<sub>w</sub> by solving for it in the above equations, but you can also take a shortcut. Since the matrix from the lecture slides in Viewing III only uses tan( θw/2), you can solve for tan( θ<sub>w</sub>/2) in terms of the aspect ratio and tan( θ<sub>h</sub>/2) and avoid having to calculate θ<sub>w</sub> at all.

### Convert Degrees to Radians

Most (all) the angles we give you in methods like setHeightAngle() and rotate<U,V,orW>()
are in degrees. You should convert these values to radians before using them. (math.h functions
such as sin, cos, tan expect radians, as do glm functions because of a line in CS123.pro that will
#define GLM_FORCE_RADIANS.)<br />

● glm::radians(degrees) converts degrees to radians and returns the result.

### Rotating the Camera

When you rotate the camera, you want to rotate the camera with respect to its own local
coordinate system – not the world coordinate system; rotating the camera around any of its axes
should not cause a translation in world space.

### Memory Management

When you create a matrix like this: glm::mat4x4 m = glm::mat4x4();, you don’t have to delete it
because that entire matrix is stored on the stack. You only have to call delete when you call new
yourself.

### U, V, and W Vectors

The U, V, and W axes should always be perpendicular! In addition, the U, V, and W axes are not
necessarily the same as your look, up, and right vectors. Make sure that when your camera is
moved, you also re-adjust the look, up, and right vectors.

## Camera

**Task 1 :**<br />
● In the CamtransCamera.h header file, add the following member variables...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ float m_aspectRatio<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ float m_near, float m_far<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ glm::mat4 m_translationMatrix, m_perspectiveTransformation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ glm::mat4 m_scaleMatrix, m_rotationMatrix<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ float m_thetaH, m_thetaW<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ glm::vec4 m_eye, m_up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ glm::vec4 m_u, m_v, m_w<br />

● In the header file, also add definitions for the following helper methods...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ void CamtransCamera::updateProjectionMatrix()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ void CamtransCamera::updatePerspectiveMatrix()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ void CamtransCamera::updateScaleMatrix()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ void CamtransCamera::updateViewMatrix()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ void CamtransCamera::updateRotationMatrix()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ void CamtransCamera::updateTranslationMatrix()<br />

● Define the above five methods in the bottom of CamtransCamera.cpp. You will fill
these in later.<br />

● Fill in the get methods inCamtransCamera.cppto return the corresponding member
variables.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ getScaleMatrix(), getPerspectiveMatrix()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ getPosition()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ (think of this as the position of the camera, or in other words the ___)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ getLook(), getU(), getV(), getW()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ getAspectRatio(), getHeightAngle()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ <b>You may need to add some of these yourself to the header and
source file, especially to run the camtrans test suite. The ones
provided are the ones used by the stencil code.</b><br />

**Task 2 :**<br />
● Fill in the empty methods you added to the CamtransCamera.cpp file for updating the<br />
**projection matrix** , **perspective matrix** , **view matrix** , **rotation matrix** ,
**translation matrix** and **scale matrix**.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ These methods should update their respective matrices with whatever current information we have saved in our member variables. We will call them when we have made changes to the member variables pertaining to the matrix. This way we don’t have to think too hard about what to change about the matrix itself; it will just refresh it entirely.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ There are no **projection** and **view matrix** member variable sin the stencil code, so in theupdateProjectionMatrix() and updatViewMatrix() methods, you will need to call the update methods of the matrices that they are composed of. <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ For example, the projection matrix is composed of the scale and perspective transform, so this method should call updateScaleMatrix() and updatePerspectiveMatrix().<br />



**Task 3 :**<br />
● InCamtransCamera::CamtransCamerain the CamtransCamera.cpp file, orient the
camera to be like the demo. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ The **near clip plane** is 1 and the far clip plane is 30. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ The **vertica view angle** is 60 degrees. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ The screen **aspect ratio** is 1:1. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ The **eye position** of the camera is at (2,2,2) in world coordinates. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ The camera is **looking** at the origin, and its **up vector** is (0,1,0) in world
coordinates. <br />

● Fill in CamtransCamera::setAspectRatioto update the **aspect ratio** and call
updateProjectionMatrix(). <br />

● Now it’s time to fill in getProjectionMatrix() and getViewMatrix(). <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ How would you calculate the projection and view matrices from our matrix
member variables? <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ **Projection matrices** are those which modify the actual projection –
matrices which are affected by changes in the view frustum (the six planes near, far, top, bottom, left, and right). The **viewmatrix** affects the
positioning of the world within the camera’s view. <br />

● InCamtransCamera::orientLook,update the eye, look, and up variables with the new
ones. Then recalculate **u** , **v** , and **w** based on those new values. Then you’ll need to call
updateViewMatrix() and updateProjectionMatrix(). <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ (Hint: glm::normalize might help here.) <br />

● In CamtransCamera::setHeightAngle, update the **heightangle** and **width angle**.
Also be sure to call updateProjectionMatrix(). Calculation help here. <br />

● In CamtransCamera::translate, you will need to move the **eye** and call
updateViewMatrix(). <br />

● In CamtransCamera::rotateU, CamtransCamera::rotateV, and
CamtransCamera::rotateW, rotate around the respective vector by a degree value and
then update the view matrix. <br />


● In CamtransCamera::setClipset the **near** and **far planes,** and call
updateProjectionMatrix(). <br />

**Your camera must support...** <br />
● maintaining matrices for the **projection transformation** and the **view
transformation**. <br />

● setting the camera’s **absolute position** and orientation given an **eye position** , **look
vector** , and **up vector**. <br />

● setting the camera’s **height angle** and **aspect ratio**. <br />


```
● translating the camera in world space.
● rotating the camera about one of the axes in its own virtual coordinate system.
● setting the near and far clipping planes.
● Having the ability to, at any point, spit out the current eye position , look vector , up
vector , height angle (in degrees), aspect ratio , or world to film matrix.
```
## Testing

You can test your camera implementation by running your project and switching to the
camtrans tab. Make sure the “Use orbit camera instead” box is not checked and you will be
presented with your shapes scene using your Camtrans implementation. Compare the results of
translations/rotations in your implementation with the results in the demo.

We have provided a **test suite** that you can use to test your CamtransCamera functionality. To
use it,

- Make sure everything runs with the new changes that you want to test on your local
    machine.
- The test script on the department machines relies on an older Qt version, change the
    memcpy() call in line 93 in SupportCanvas2D.cpp from temp->sizeInBytes() to
    temp->byteCount().
- Push everything to your repo. Clone it into your folder on department machines through
    either FastX3, ssh, or in person.
- Then run ```python2 /course/cs1230/bin/cs1230_camtrans_test``` from the directory containing your CS123.pro file.

## End

Now you are ready to show your program to a TA to get checked off!
Be prepared to answer one or more of the following: <br />
● Question 1: What is the difference between the projection matrix and the view matrix? <br />
● Question 2: Question 3: Briefly explain what each matrix is responsible for doing and
show a TA how each matrix is calculated in your code: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ M1: Scaling the perspective <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ M2: Rotation <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ M3: Translation <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ M4: Original Point <br />

## Food for thought

Oh snap! Your camera can now display three-dimensional objects oriented in any way and
viewed from any position! This lab will be used in future project assignments.
